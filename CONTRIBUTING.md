### Please read before contributing

1) If you have questions about Devise, search the [Wiki](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki) or use the [Mailing List](groups.google.com/group/plataformatec-devise) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/devise). Do not post questions here;

2) If you found a security bug, do not submit an issue here. Instead please send an e-mail to [developers@plataformatec.com.br](mailto:developers@plataformatec.com.br) instead;

3) Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to see if it was already reported / fixed. In case it was not, create your report including Rails, Devise and Warden versions. If you are getting exceptions, please include the full backtrace;

That's it. The more information you can give or if you can reproduce the issue in Devise test's suite or in a sample application, it will be easier for us to track it down and fix it.

Thanks!
