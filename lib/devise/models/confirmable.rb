    # Confirmable is responsible to verify if an account is already confirmed to
    # sign in, and to send emails with confirmation instructions.
    # Confirmation instructions are sent to the user email after creating a
    # record, after updating it's email and also when manually requested by
    # a new confirmation instruction request.
    # Whenever the user update it's email, his account is automatically unconfirmed,
    # it means it won't be able to sign in again without confirming the account
    # again through the email that was sent.
    # Confirmable also hooks into authenticate, to verify if the account is
    # confirmed or not before authenticating the user.
    # Examples:
    #
    #   User.authenticate('email@test.com', 'password123') # true if it's confirmed, otherwise false
    #   User.find(1).confirm!      # returns true unless it's already confirmed
    #   User.find(1).confirmed?    # true/false
    #   User.find(1).send_confirmation_instructions # manually send instructions
    #   User.find(1).reset_confirmation! # reset confirmation status and send instructions
